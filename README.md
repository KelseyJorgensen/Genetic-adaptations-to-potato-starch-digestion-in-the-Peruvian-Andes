All populations used in this analysis are from publically available datasets, either the 1000 Genomes Project: https://www.internationalgenome.org or the Affymetrix Human Origins Array. Data files are subsetted by the population of interest, such as PEL, GWD/MSL, CHB/CHS. 


This repository contains the raw, phased VCF file used for statistics in this selection scan study. 
The VCF file contains:

Populations used from the 1000 Genomes Project (Consortium, 2015)
      Peruvians from Lima, Peru (PEL, n=85)
      Han Chinese in Beijing (CHB, n=103) 
      Southern Han Chinese (CHS, n=105)
      the Mende in Sierra Leone (MSL, n=85)
      Gambian Mandinkas (GWD, n=113)
            
Dataset
	For this dataset, we used the Phase 3 (hg19) VCF files via the ftp server (http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/).
	The 513,494 SNPs queried were:
	A) the SNPs from our candidate genes (11,280 SNPs)
	B) the SNP locations used in the Affymetrix Human Origins Array to represent a distribution across all autosomes (502,214 SNPs) (Patterson et al., 2012)
